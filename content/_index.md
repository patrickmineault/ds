Hi, I'm Patrick Mineault. This is my data science portfolio.

# Experience

After an undergrad in math and physics, I did my PhD on the computational neuroscience of vision at McGill, focusing on statistical models of single neurons and whole humans. I did a postdoc at UCLA focusing on Bayesian decoding of neural activity. At Google, I was hired as a software engineer, and ended up doing [data science in Ads Metrics](https://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/), the crack team of statisticians that keeps ads on the search engine results page running. At Facebook, I was a research scientist [working on brain-computer interfaces](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-19/facebook-s-building-8-envisions-using-brain-waves-to-type-words), using data science to design state-of-the-art mind-reading systems. I was CTO at Neuromatch Academy, a non-profit that delivered a neural data science curriculum to thousands of students around the world.

# Skills

I like Python and its data science ecosystem; I've written a [few articles](https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/) and [given some presentations](https://github.com/patrickmineault/research_code) to people wanting to switch to this ecosystem. My background is on the classical statistical side; inferential statistics, the bootstrap, GAMs, Bayesian modelling, causal inference. I've also been doing deep learning since the beginning, first in Theano, then in Tensorflow, now in PyTorch. As a vision scientist, my experiences tend towards vision applications, but I've also dabbled in natural language processing.

In addition to Python, I've written in R and go professionally. I also practice Julia and Javascript from time to time in case our coming robot overlords prefer it.

# What I care about

Brains, the climate, and helping people. I want to use data science to give people better opportunities for people in the future.

# My analysis philosophy

> It needs to be done fast; it needs to be correct

Business and non-profit ventures need to move fast to catch opportunities. Data science needs to be close to product to understand how users would benefit from its insights. Having correct answers at the right time is what's important, not the fanciness of the method that found it.
