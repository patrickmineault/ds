This is my data science portfolio.
Experience After an undergrad in math and physics, I did my PhD on the computational neuroscience of vision at McGill, focusing on statistical models of single neurons and whole humans. I did a postdoc at UCLA focusing on Bayesian decoding of neural activity. At Google, I was hired as a software engineer, and ended up doing data science in Ads Metrics, the crack team of statisticians that keeps ads on the search engine results page running.</description></item></channel></rss>
